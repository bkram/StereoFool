// Regression tests that measure wall-clock cost of the real-time DSP path.
//
// These catch the class of regression that dropped audio 3-5 s into every
// engine start on release/MPXPrime-0.10 pre-fix: commit b806053 relocated
// pre-emphasis from M/S (inside makeCompositeComponents, 2 filter passes on
// mixed signals) to L/R upstream of the pre-encode limiter (2 filter passes,
// same count, BUT now feeding the limiter a signal with a 10-12 dB HF boost).
// The limiter then ran near-constantly in gain reduction with HF-rich program
// material, and the combined per-sample cost exceeded the real-time budget
// on busy systems — producing ring overflow.
//
// Strategy: process a full second of worst-case HF-rich stereo through the
// complete MPXGenerator chain in realistic ~512-frame blocks, measure wall
// time, and require a safety margin over the audio deadline. A regression
// that makes the chain >~30% slower on the test machine will fail one of
// these cases. The absolute thresholds are intentionally generous (4x
// headroom) so the suite doesn't flake on slow CI runners; the real signal
// is relative budget changes, not exact absolute ms.
//
// A canary test runs an equivalent processingBypass=true render against the
// same input so machine speed can be inferred: if the bypass pass takes
// longer than its own budget, the host is overloaded and the full-chain
// comparisons are allowed to be looser (the budget auto-scales).
