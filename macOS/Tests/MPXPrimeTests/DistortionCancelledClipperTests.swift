/// Tests for `DistortionCancelledClipper`.
///
/// The clipper currently runs at native sample rate. Its `tanh` nonlinearity
/// generates harmonics of the input above Nyquist that alias straight back into
/// the audio band. The LP-based error-cancellation in the clipper kills LF IMD
/// products but does not address HF aliasing.
///
/// Phase 7.1 wraps the clipper in 8x oversampling, which moves aliased
/// products above the reconstruction LP cutoff so they get filtered out
/// rather than landing in-band. These tests provide the objective measurement.
///
/// Test signal selection (5111 Hz @ 48 kHz):
/// - In-band real harmonics: 5111, 10222, 15333, 20444 Hz
/// - Above-Nyquist harmonics that fold back: 25555 -> 22445,
///   30666 -> 17334, 35777 -> 12223, 40888 -> 7112, 46000 -> 2000 Hz
/// - The 5 alias bins are well separated from the 4 real harmonics.
